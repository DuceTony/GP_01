- What did you build during this phase?

Answer : During this phase of our development, we have our user personas and we have a working first version of Motiv8+.
Some functionalities work but the rest are still under construction.

- High-level design of your software.
Answer : 

- Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.

Answer : So far, we have noticed that sometimes instead of getting one entire part of a project finished, you end up getting sections of it done and that way you eventually learn how to piece them all together like a puzzle. We have observed that time management and communciation is very important in a 
high functioning team but it is easier said than done. 

- Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what needs improvement.

Answer : Our teammork has been a bit rocky as we have all been trying to get our schedules to agree with one another's. After the sit down with
Mr. Hoye, my team and I got a better understanding of delegating tasks to team memebers and such as this isnt a skill necessarily taught at school. While 
we are trying to put this practice into work, it is gradually getting to where we want it to be. 

- Triage: What will you build for the final demo?
Answer : For the final demo we hope to have a completely functional extension that we will be able to share publicly, receive feedback, and modify things
best according to what our users want.
