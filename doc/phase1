We anticipate coding challenges such as figuring out how to make things work in the manner we want them to. 

How will you divide the work?
Our work will be divided by our teammates strengths capabilities to make the process smoother.
Darius & David will work on backend coding and I will work on the frontend aspect.

Our Intended Audience
â—‹ Your users - we need 2 to 3 convincing user stories, reasons that a person derives value from your software that believably link up to the product design. (DAVID)
I spoke to a long-time friend and fellow student about our project. He stated that it is difficult for him to manage his time and stay motivated while working for long periods.
He expressed his excitement for the development of a project that would help him overcome his deficiencies.

As someone who struggles with paying attention and working at a steady pace, I believe an extension like this will be invaluable to both myself and those like me.
